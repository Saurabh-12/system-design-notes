# System Design Notes

These are all the notes I've taken while studying for system design interivews. The top resources I've used are:

- [_Designing Data Intensive Applications_](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=designing+data+intensive+applications&link_code=qs&qid=1705798730&sr=8-1), by Martin Kleppmann
- [jordanhasnolife's System Design 2.0 Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTveVh7FakLdTmm42TMxbN8PvVn5g4KJ)
- [ByteByteGo's System Design Fundamentals Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX4CrbXMsNQ&list=PLCRMIe5FDPsd0gVs500xeOewfySTsmEjf)
- Donne Martin's [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on Github

I'm currently working on turning these notes into an interactive study tool. You can check that out [here](https://software-system-quiz.vercel.app/)
