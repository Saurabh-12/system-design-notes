# Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

First, let's look at the different ways we can scale a system

**Vertical scaling** means improving the performance of our system by upgrading the hardware of our application server or database node.

**Horizontal scaling** means improving performance by distributing computational load across more machines, which are usually commodity hardware. This is typically where load balancing comes into play
