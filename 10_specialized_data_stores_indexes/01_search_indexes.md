# Search Indexes

Database indexes arenâ€™t very good for text searching because our search term might be any single substring of text stored in our DB

Search indices solve this problem using _inverted indexes_. Let's take a look at a few:

**Prefix Inverted Index**

In a prefix inverted index, we tokenize all the strings in our data and pair them with references to documents which contain those string tokens.

**Suffix Inverted Index**

A suffix inverted index is essentially the same as prefix-inverted indexes, except we store reversed tokens. It allows us to easily search suffixes by using the reversed the suffix as our search term string and proceeding as normal

**Apache Lucene** is a popular open source search engine that supports complex text searches, Levenshtein distance, numerical searches, etc.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a convenience wrapper on top of Apache Lucene to allow for searching in a distributed system. It also provides some nice features out of the box:

- REST API
- Query language
- Managed replication and partitioning
- Visualization

There are a couple of optimizations in Elasticsearch architecture that make it well suited for searching.

First, Elasticsearch caches more common/frequently accessed parts of a query instead of the full query result or a piece of an index.

Next, it uses a local secondary index as opposed to a global index. This ensures that when we're writing to our index, we won't have to potentially write to multiple different partition nodes.

As a result, we generally want to keep searches to one partition instead of aggregating search results across many partitions
